# Rehab Robotics Studio

## What This Is

Rehab Robotics Studio is a local LabVIEW-style rehabilitation robotics GUI and ROS 2 backend for collecting, processing, and recording paired ESP32 IMU data. It provides a practical operator surface for live acquisition, SD sessions, and biomechanical monitoring.

## Core Value

Reliable live ESP32 motion data must flow through a reproducible ROS 2 pipeline into usable filtered, biomechanical, and recorded outputs.

## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Shipped and confirmed valuable. -->

- Existing ROS 2 package scaffold and TCP ESP32 bridge are present, but the end-to-end hardware pipeline is not yet validated.

### Active

- [ ] Generate a typed ROS processing-block update draft whenever a valid processing block is connected directly to a source block.
- [ ] Publish a finalized processing-block update when the operator deploys the graph.
- [ ] Package one language-neutral source entry file with manifest YAML, dependencies, graph identity, revision, checksum, and deployment metadata.
- [ ] Provide a local ROS observer or inspection path that verifies generated messages while the Jetson is disconnected.

### Out of Scope

- Generic neural-acquisition functions such as impedance measurement, headstage configuration, DAC audio routing, and AUX/ADC routing - not relevant to the paired IMU workflow.
- ESP32 firmware protocol redesign - the GUI should expose the existing plugin-compatible commands.
- Motor-control and EtherCAT integration - unrelated to IMU acquisition operations.

## Current Milestone: v1.2 Block Deployment

**Goal:** Turn source-connected processing blocks into reproducible, inspectable ROS deployment messages that a future Jetson updater can consume.

**Target features:**
- Draft-on-connect message generation for processing blocks wired directly to acquisition sources such as EMG or load-cell blocks.
- Final-on-Deploy typed ROS publication with manifest YAML, one language-neutral source entry file, dependencies, identity, revision, and integrity metadata.
- Local message inspection and validation without requiring a connected Jetson or Tailscale route.

## Context

The GUI already has a typed block graph, custom block-folder loading through `block.json`, graph connection events, and a mocked Deploy action. The ROS 2 backend already exposes processing primitives and rosbridge integration. Acquisition Operations v1.1 reached implementation completion, with its audit/archive still pending; v1.2 focuses only on producing the updater-facing contract and locally observable ROS messages.

## Constraints

- **Protocol compatibility**: Follow the plugin repository's live handshake, UDP frame validation, node-role metadata, and JSON schema - it is the requested behavioral reference.
- **ROS 2 compatibility**: Keep standard ROS 2 launch/package conventions and retain rosbridge access for the GUI.
- **Safety and observability**: Pipeline stages must report malformed data, connection loss, and recording failures rather than silently dropping them.
- **Repository hygiene**: Preserve unrelated work already present in the dirty working tree.
- **Disconnected target**: The Jetson is not currently connected, so v1.2 must be testable entirely through local ROS publication and inspection.
- **Code safety**: Creating and inspecting a message must not execute user-provided processing code in the browser or local ROS bridge.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use the plugin acquisition board as the hardware-operation reference | The user wants operational equivalence for the paired ESP32 workflow | Active |
| Treat Rec as parallel SD logging, not the acquisition switch | Run/Stop and recording need independent semantics in the lab workflow | Implemented |
| Require confirmed hardware acknowledgements before the GUI commits a setting | Prevents the UI from reporting a configuration that the board rejected | Implemented |
| Use a typed ROS processing-block update contract | Explicit fields make the future updater deterministic and versionable while still carrying YAML and code text | Active |
| Generate drafts on connection and finalize on Deploy | Connection provides immediate feedback while Deploy remains the operator-controlled release boundary | Active |
| Keep the source payload language-neutral and single-entry | Supports future processor languages without introducing archive handling in v1.2 | Active |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `$gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `$gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check - still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope - reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
